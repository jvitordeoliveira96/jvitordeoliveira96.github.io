Hey there! I am a computer scientist with experience in code development, teaching and research. I'm interested in computer modeling, numerical and optimization algorithms, Bayesian inference and metamodeling. More recently, I started to get involved with data science. 

I earned my M.Sc. in Scientific Computing from [Laboratório Nacional de Computação Científica](https://lncc.br) in 2021 and my B.Sc. in Computer Science in 2018 from [Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro](https://ufrj.br). In the latter, I worked as a temporary university lecturer in the [Computer Science Institute](https://dcc.ufrj.br) from March 2020 to March 2022. I currently hold a position of scientific programmer/researcher at [LMMP/PUC-Rio](http://lmmp.mec.puc-rio.br/lmmp/).
