This work proposes an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach for estimating model parameters of a mechanistic multiscale tumor growth problem. This ABC strategy uses a low-fidelity Gaussian Process Regression metamodel, constructed adaptively from previous executions of the mechanistic model. The proposed approach is compared to standard ABC methods in terms of accuracy and computational burden.
