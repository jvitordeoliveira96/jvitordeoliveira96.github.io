I am a computer scientist with experience in code development, teaching and research. I am interested in computer modeling, numerical and optimization algorithms, Bayesian inference and metamodeling. Recently, I started to get involved with data science projects.

I hold M.Sc. in Scientific Computing from [Laboratório Nacional de Computação Científica](https://lncc.br) and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro](https://ufrj.br). In the latter, I worked as a university lecturer in the [Computer Science Institute](https://dcc.ufrj.br) for two years (2020-2022). I also worked as a scientific programmer at [LMMP/PUC-Rio](http://lmmp.mec.puc-rio.br/lmmp/) from September 2022 to July 2023. I am currently a Applied Mathematics PhD Student at [University of Colorado, Denver](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/mathematical-and-statistical-sciences/).
