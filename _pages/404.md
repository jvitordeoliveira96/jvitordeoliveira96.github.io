Sorry, but the page you were trying to view does not exist --- perhaps you can try searching for it below.

<p id="test"></p>

<script>
    var quotes = ["$$f(x) = x^2$$", "$$f(x) = x^3$$", "$$f(x) = x^6$$", "$$f(x) = x^5$$", "$$f(x) = x^{-1}$$"];
    var index = Math.floor((Math.random() * quotes.length)); 
    document.getElementById('test').innerHTML = quotes[index];
