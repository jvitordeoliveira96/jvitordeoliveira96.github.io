I am a computer scientist with experience in software development, teaching, and research. My interests include computer modeling, numerical and optimization algorithms, Bayesian inference, and metamodeling. Recently, I have also become involved in data science projects.

I hold an M.Sc. in Scientific Computing from [Laboratório Nacional de Computação Científica](https://lncc.br) and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro](https://ufrj.br). At [Computer Science Institute](https://dcc.ufrj.br), I worked as a university lecturer at the Computer Science Institute for two years (2020–2022). I also worked as a scientific programmer at [LMMP/PUC-Rio](http://lmmp.mec.puc-rio.br/lmmp/) from September 2022 to July 2023. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in Applied Mathematics at [University of Colorado, Denver](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/mathematical-and-statistical-sciences/)  and completed a summer internship at [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/) from May to August 2024, where I worked on Green AI and mixed-precision methods.
